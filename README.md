# Tanuja's Portfolio

Hey there! I'm Tanuja — a passionate Computer Science student exploring the worlds of Full Stack Development and AI. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey, showcasing the projects I've built, the technologies I love, and the problems I'm excited to solve.

## What This Is

This is my personal developer portfolio website, built using:

-  React (Vite + TypeScript)
-  Tailwind CSS for styling
-  GitHub for version control & hosting

It's designed to give a quick but meaningful glimpse into who I am, what I’ve worked on, and how I think about tech.

##  Features

- Responsive, clean UI
- Smooth scroll navigation
- Sections like Hero, About, Projects, Skills, and Contact
- Deployed on [GitHub Pages / Vercel] (coming soon!)

##  How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanuja-luffy/tanuja-portfolio.git
cd tanuja-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
